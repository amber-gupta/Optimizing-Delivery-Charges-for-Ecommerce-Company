You are a data analyst and have a large ecommerce company in India (let’s call it X) as a client.
X gets a few thousand orders via their website on a daily basis and they have to deliver them as
fast as they can. For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple
courier companies in India who charge them some amount per delivery.
The charges are dependent upon two factors:
● Weight of the product
● Distance between the warehouse (pickup location) and customer’s delivery address
(destination location)
On an average, the delivery charges are Rs. 100 per shipment. So if X ships 1,00,000 orders
per month, they have to pay approximately Rs. 1 crore to the courier companies on a monthly
basis as charges.

As the amount that X has to pay to the courier companies is very high, they want to verify if the
charges levied by their partners per Order are correct.
